# Baby_Name_Statistics
Keeping the statistics data from sourse in html byPython + reporting the results in PowerBI
"""
  Given a file name for baby.html, returns a list starting with the year string
  followed by the name-rank strings in alphabetical order.
  ['2006', 'Aaliyah 91', Aaron 57', 'Abagail 895', ' ...]
...

Suggested milestones for incremental development:
 -Extract the year and print it
 -Extract the names and rank numbers and just print them
 -Get the names data into a dict and print it
 -Build the [year, 'name rank', ... ] list and print it
 -Fix main() to use the extract_names list
